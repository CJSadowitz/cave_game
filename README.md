# Caving Game
I think that one of *the* if not *the* most fun things in minecraft is caving </br>
This game is inspired from the destructability and experience minecraft provides </br>

## Installation
*Using terminal or powershell* </br>
Simply clone this repository: `git clone http://` </br>
**Vulkan Related Installation** </br>
Navigate to installation directory: `cd installation/` </br>
`bash vulkan_installation.sh` </br>
`bash glfw_installation.sh` </br>

## Building
*Using terminal or powershell* </br>
Should be simple @Colin </br>
Navigate to the build directory: `cd build/` </br>
Run CMake: `cmake ..` </br>
Build Game: `make` </br>

## Running
*Using terminal or powershell* </br>
Run: `./cave_game` </br>
**FIND WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE FOR WINDOWS** </br>

## What it is
### Voxel Game
This is going to start as an exersize for me to build a voxel game with destruction mechanics </br>
I hope that this can have more fine detail than minecraft does and I plan to lean into the voxel mechanics </br>
I hope to make an environment very similar to what *John Lin* achieved with his rendering </br>
### Efficient
As a prerequisite, this has to be efficient because my laptop is a *potatoe* </br>
I have found many resources about making rendering more efficient for voxel engines </br>
Those that successfully help me increase performance will be listed below: </br>

### Features (Non-Gameplay)
Genuinely Infinite Game... </br>
This kind will be interesting, I may have to scrap this If I want multiplayer because </br>
knowing player locations and properly sending information with a server becomes an interesting problem </br>
For a single player experience making it genuinely infinite is possible (I think) </br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3D chunks, in minecraft techincally the chunks are 3D but the Z-axis (y in the game) goes to world limits </br>
This would allow my game to be "infintely generating" in all directions allowing for more interesting caves </br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I intend for the chunks to have smaller detail again similar to *John Lin*, however, I haven't a clue how that will </br>
work just yet... </br>
